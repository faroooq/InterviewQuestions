Streams works on Collection object. i.e on List, Set, Map.

If you want to perform bulk operation on collection object then we use streams.

# Steps involved in streams?

1.  **Creating:** Creating step is nothing but adding the data to some collection object like List or Set or Map.

2.  **Configuring:** Configuring a stream will be done in 2 ways. By using filter() and by using map()

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="placeholder" style="width:'50%'"/></div>

<br/>

1.  **Processing:** Processing a stream will be done in 7 ways. By using collect(), count(), sorted() etc..

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="placeholder" style="width:'50%'"/></div>

# What is difference between filter and map?

filter - filter is used to filter or fetch the data in the collection object.

17             List modifiedList = list.stream().filter(x -> x >= 15).collect(Collectors.toList());
18             modifiedList.stream().forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));
```

<br/>

map - map is used to perform some operation to the collection object.

```java
21             list.stream().map(i -> i * i).forEach(x -> System.out.println(x));
```

<br/>

# Processing methods

**collect** - collect is used to collect the data to some list or set or map

<br/>


<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->

```java
23             List collectedList = list.stream().filter(x -> x >= 15).collect(Collectors.toList());
```

<br/>

**count -** count is used to count the number of elements in the stream.

<br/>


<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ com/code/java8/streams/StreamsDemo.java
```java
25             long streamCount = collectedList.stream().count();
```
